# Spring boot / REST examples for trainees
This repos hold some basic examples for spring boot.
## Server
The server will contain some CRUD (create, read, update, delete) 
end points that can be used.
In this case the server will provide some basic functions for maintaining holiday places.
## Client
A client will be able to read those data and/or a subset of data.
In this case we use the Jersey Client Framework with Jackson.
